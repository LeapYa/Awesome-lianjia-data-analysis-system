## Project Overview

The Lianjia Rental Data Collection & Analysis System is a rental data processing platform built with Python + Vue3. It primarily addresses the automated collection, processing of Lianjia's anti-crawling mechanisms, data storage, analysis, and visualization of rental data from Lianjia.com. 

The backend uses FastAPI to build API services, the crawler module combines DrissionPage for browser automation control, the verification code processing module uses OpenCV to identify and handle slider CAPTCHAs, data processing employs PySpark for batch analysis, and PostgreSQL serves as the primary database for storing crawled property data and analysis results. 

The frontend is built with Vue3 and Element Plus for the user interface, implementing data visualization through ECharts. The system also features user authentication, IP proxy management, and CAPTCHA processing to effectively counter Lianjia's anti-crawling mechanisms, ensuring stable and reliable data collection.
